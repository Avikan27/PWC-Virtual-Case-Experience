# PWC Virtual Case Experience

Welcome to the PWC-Virtual-Experience repository! This repository contains dashboards and data files from the virtual experience project I completed at PwC Switzerland through Forage.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three sections, with the objective of visualizing customer and agent behavior by creating a comprehensive dashboard that reflects the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## 1. Call Center Trends 

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this section is to create a dashboard for a telecom company that visualizes customer and agent behavior in the call center, highlighting key insights and performance indicators.

### 1.2 KPIs to Visualize 

The following KPIs will be visualized in the dashboard:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time vs calls answered)

### 1.3 Dataset

PwC provided a cleaned dataset for this study. The dataset consists of attributes such as:
- Agent
- Date
- Satisfaction Rating
- Average talk duration, etc.

### 1.4 Data Visualization

The project utilizes Power BI to create interactive dashboards. DAX functions were used to create new measures required for calculating and visualizing all the primary and secondary KPIs.

Feel free to explore the dashboards and data files in this repository to gain insights into the call center trends and performance at PwC Switzerland.

## 2. Customer Retention 

### 2.1 Obejective

To visualize customer information to understand customer behaviour inorder to reduce churn in telecom industry.

### 2.2 Problem
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

### 2.3 Dataset

PwC provided a labeled and cleaned dataset for this study. The dataset consists of attributes such as:
- CustomerID
- Demographics
- Services Used
- Payment Methods
- Contract Type
- Monthly Charges, etc

### 2.4 Data Visualization
I carried out data visualization in Power BI. Various measures were created using DAX functions so that they can help visualize the KPIs clearly.
The Customer Retention dashboard consist of tile which describe KPIs like
- Customer churn rate
- Demographics
- Payment Method used
- Services signed up for
- Paperless billing

Slicers are added to filter the data according to customer churn result and payment method used to clearly understand customer behaviour. 

## 3. Diversity & Inclusion

### 3.1 Objective
To understand the gender balance at various levels in the telecom company inorder to improve diversity and inculsion.

### 3.2 Problem
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

### 3.3 Possible KPIs
- #of men
- #of women
- #of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women

### 3.4 Dataset 
PwC provided a cleaned dataset for this study. The dataset consists of attributes such as:
- EmployeeID
- Employee Dapartment
- Promoted?
- Nationality
- Office Location, etc

### 3.5 Data Visualization 
Power BI is used to create  a detailed visualization of Diversity and Inculsion.
The visualization give insights on employee information at various job levels and across locations.
